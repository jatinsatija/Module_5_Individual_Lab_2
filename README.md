# Boston Housing Analysis with Apache Spark

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project on the Boston Housing dataset using Apache Spark. 
The analysis covers various stages including data loading, preprocessing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction using PCA, linear regression modeling, and model evaluation.

# Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the use of Apache Spark for big data analytics, particularly focusing on the Boston Housing dataset. 
The goal is to build a predictive model for the median value of owner-occupied homes (medv) based on various features.

# Project Overview

The analysis involves the following steps:

Data Loading: Reading the Boston Housing dataset into a Spark DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing: Assembling features and scaling them.

PCA: Applying Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.

Linear Regression: Building and evaluating a linear regression model.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using CrossValidator for hyperparameter tuning.
